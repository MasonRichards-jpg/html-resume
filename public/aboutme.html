            The first influence in my life to turn me to the world of tech would have to <br>
            be the moment I received my first gaming console for Christmas that being a wii.<br> 
            Upon booting it up I was immediately mesmerized and immersed into it's world. <br>
            It filled me with curiosity and wonder about how this was even possible.<br>
            I discovered MSOE pretty early on in my life as I grew up in Milwaukee. <br>
            I never was really interested in the school however until I did more research about <br>
            their programs and saw how great they truly are. Through MSOE I have found my love for <br>
            UX and UI design and have been given the opportunity to work on various projects.<br>
